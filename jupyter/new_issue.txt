This JupyterHub has thrown me issue after issue, below is the latest one reported as issue #2172
https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/issues/2172

I am able to start JupyterHub integrated with LDAP now.

I need to set up the security practice here:

We have a dedicated account sid to start the JHub from sid's home;
After the JHub is started, all authorized users should be able to log in as long as s/he can authenticate against in the LDAP;
For the sid's home, the three files: config, key, cert are set to 755 along with the sid's home folder;

I received the following error messages when logging as myself:
